## CacheSim
CacheSim contains an inheritable Cache class to create Cache hierarchies.  
We have used it to implement CEASER caches and simulate PPT and GE attacks on it.

## Instructions
Just compile ge_attacker.cpp or ppt_attacker.cpp with C++14 or later and run the executable!  
1000x faster than champsim and works with L1D attacker acceses!

## Current Status
ge_attacker.cpp is bugged after cache.hpp changes. Please fix.
